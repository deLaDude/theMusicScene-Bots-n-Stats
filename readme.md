# This code is currently not under active development. 

It consists of two major components:
* the bots that gather data (/bots)
* the api that provides access to the data (/api)

Neither are very mature at the moment and have pretty limited functionality, but they work!

Dependencies: 
* Node
* NPM
* [TT API](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API)
* MongoDB
* MongoJS
