# This code is currently not under active development. 

It consists of two major components:
* the bots that gather data (/bots)
* the api that provides access to the data (/api)

Neither are very mature at the moment and have pretty limited functionality, but they work!

Here's a [postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en) collections of the currently available api calls: http://www.getpostman.com/collections/8cecc4109bfb08fd5e28

Dependencies: 
* Node
* NPM
* [TT API](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API)
* MongoDB
* MongoJS
